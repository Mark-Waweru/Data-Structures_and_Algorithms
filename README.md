# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repo contains two folders:

**1. Data Structures** - which contains code solutions to leet code problems on examples of data structures such as *Linked Lists, Trees, Arrays, Graphs and hash tables*. The code solutions will be coded in two languages each which is *C and Python*.

**2. Algorithms** - which will contain code solutions to some algorithms coding styles such as *Sorting Algorithms, Hashing Algorithms, Cryptography algorithms* and others.

---
The files will be named with the problem name in leet code for learning purposes so as to ease the searching of a problem's code solution. You are free to collaborate on how best I can solve some of the problems and i will be open to review, collaborate and accept pull requests.
